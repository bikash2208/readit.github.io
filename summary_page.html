            <h2>The Book in Three Sentences</h2>
            <p class="summary-p">Practicing meditation and mindfulness will make you at least 10 percent happier. Being
              mindful does not change the problems in your life, but mindfulness does help you respond
              to
              your problems rather than react to them. Mindfulness helps you realize that striving for
              success is fine as long as you accept that the outcome is outside your control.

            <h2>10% Happier summary</h2>
            <p class="summary-p">This is my book summary of 10% Happier by Dan Harris. My notes are informal and often
              contain
              quotes from the book as well as my own thoughts. This summary also includes key lessons
              and
              important passages from the book.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul-li"><em>“My preconceptions about meditation were misconceptions.”</em>
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li"><em>“In my experience, meditation makes you 10% happier.”</em></li>
              <li class="ul-li">Some of the traits we think are fixed like a quick temper or
                moody-ness or
                compassion
                are learned skills, not fixed characteristics.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Many people assume they must be paranoid and worry if they want to
                stay at
                the top of
                their game.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">People care a lot about the bio on an author's page.</li>
              <li class="ul-li"><em>“The best parts of Eckhart Tolle were a form of Buddhism.”</em>
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Most improvements in life make very little difference and <em>that's
                  fine</em>. We spend
                so much time searching for transformational change in one easy step, but can we all
                just
                admit that were looking for the easy way out here? Just because you can't change
                everything at once doesn't mean you can't get better. In many cases, most cases in
                fact,
                you are only going to see a very small increase from each action. One workout builds
                a
                very small amount of muscle. That is what is to be expected. You're not doing it
                wrong
                if you get very tiny results. Most strategies deliver tiny results and require
                consistent over a long period of time. In the book, Harris makes a comment about
                therapy
                only working a little bit: “The limit isn't your therapist. The limit is therapy
                itself.” It makes a small difference, but it still makes a difference. The key is to
                embrace these daily marginal gains rather than dismissing them because they are
                small.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Meditation is like doing focused reps for your mind. Focus on the
                breath,
                lose your
                focus, bring it back to the breath, repeat. This is the whole game. Keep bringing
                your
                mind back to the breath.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">How to meditate: sit somewhere comfortable, keep a straight spine,
                focus
                on a spot, and
                bring your focus back to your breath whenever you lose it.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Meditation helps you shut down your monkey mind for a moment.</li>
              <li class="ul-li">We have 3 habitual responses to everything we experience: 1) We want
                it.
                2) We reject
                it. 3) We zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth response. Viewing what happens in the
                world
                without an emotional response about it.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li"><em>“Mindfulness represents an alternative to living reactively.”</em>
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Interesting self-sabotage insight: many people worry that if they
                meditate
                they will
                lose their edge and no longer be competitive or driven.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li"><em>“When you squelch something you give it power. Ignorance is not
                  bliss.”</em> You
                should not run from your problems and pain. You should acknowledge them.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">The R.A.I.N. Technique for meditation: Recognize. Allow. Investigate.
                Non-identification. 1) Recognize: Acknowledge your feelings. 2) Allow: Where you
                lean
                into the pain. Let the pain be. 3) Investigate: Check out how the situation is
                impacting
                your body. Is my face hot? Is my back tight? Etc. 4) Non-identification: Realize
                that
                just because you feel pain or frustration or guilt or anger right now does not mean
                you
                are an angry or broken person. It is simply a phase happening at this moment, not
                your
                identity as a person.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Mindfulness seems to be about awareness of the self. You recognize and
                acknowledge the
                things going on around you and the emotions you are feeling. Rather than let the
                emotion
                drive everything, you step outside of it and see it from afar.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Being mindful does not change the problems in your life. You still
                need to
                take action,
                but the key is that mindfulness allows you to respond rather than react to the
                problems
                in your life.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Hedonic adaptation: the observed tendency of humans to quickly return
                to a
                relatively
                stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes.

              </li>
              <li class="ul-li"><em>“Everything we experience in this world goes through one filter —
                  our
                  minds — and we
                  spend very little time bothering to see how it works.”</em>
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Meditation will make you more resilient, but it is not a “cure all”
                that
                fixes your
                problems or relieves all stress in your life.

              <li class="ul-li">One Harvard study shows that gray matter grows in meditators. This is
                known as
                neuroplasticity.

              <li class="ul-li">Scientists have developed a term for the consequence of all our

                partial attention.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">The Dalai Lama has a theory on selfishness: We should strive to be
                wise
                selfish rather
                than foolish selfish. Foolish selfish is when you focus on self-centered and shallow
                activities. Wise selfish is when you show compassion and help others because it
                benefits
                you and makes you feel good. Compassion is in our own self-interest.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Make eye contact and smile at people. This simple habit that will make
                you
                feel more
                connected and much better each day.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">When police officers or first responders are interviewed about how and
                why
                they acted in
                a particular way during an emergency they often say, <em>“My training kicked
                  in.”</em> I
                like this idea of training yourself to be mindful, aware, compassionate, and so on.
                These are traits that can be trained and then will automatically reveal themselves
                when
                needed (assuming you have practiced enough).
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Do not confuse letting go with going soft. Just because you are aware of
                what is going on
                and being mindful about it does not mean you just let things go when you have the
                ability to take action on them and improve. The way to respond to adversity is often
                to
                work through it, not to avoid it altogether in the name of acting Zen.
              </li>
              <li class="ul-li">Striving for success is fine as long as you realize that the outcome
                is
                not under your
                control. Be as ambitious as possible, but let go of the result. This makes it easier
                for
                you to be resilient and bounce back if the result is poor.
